| Where does the HuBERT model go?  | All HuBERT models download automatically to `data/models/hubert`                                              |
| RVC models don't get downloaded. | RVC models have to manually be downloaded and installed, unzip them into a folder inside of `data/models/rvc` |

| Launching takes a long time, it's always installing packages | Launch with the `--skip-install` flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| I want to host the app over my local network                 | Launch with the `-l`/`--listen` flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| I want to use a different port                               | Launch with the `--port xxxx` flag where `xxxx` is the port you want to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| I'm running out of VRAM (CUDA Out Of Memory error)           | Launch with `--bark-cpu-offload` for much lower vram usage at the cost of a small speed decrease, use `--bark-low-vram` to reduce vram usage and increase speed at the cost of quality. And use `--bark-use-cpu` to fully run the model on the CPU, with no VRAM usage, likely at the cost of a lot of speed. |
| Models aren't loading. The loading stays frozen.             | Something's wrong with the file path of audio-webui (Too long?) Launch with the `--no-data-cache`                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
